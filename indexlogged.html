                        IT’S SPRING WHEN I REALIZE that I may never have children, and around that time the
                        thirteen-year cicadas return, burrowing out of neat, round holes in the ground to shed their
                        larval shells, sprout wings, and fly to the treetops, filling the air with the sound of their
                        singular purpose: reproduction. In the woods where I live, an area mostly protected from habitat
                        destruction, the males’ mating song, a vibrating, whooshing, endless hum, a sound at once
                        faraway and up-close, makes me feel like I am living inside a seashell.

                        Near the river, where the song is louder, their discarded larval shells — translucent amber
                        bodies, weightless and eerie — crunch underfoot on my daily walks. Across the river, in a nest
                        constructed near the top of a tall, spindly pine, bald eagles take turns caring for two new
                        eaglets. Baby turtles, baby snakes, and ducklings appear on the water. Under my parents’ porch,
                        three feral cats give birth in quick succession. And on the news, a miracle pregnancy: Jamani,
                        an eleven-year-old female gorilla at the North Carolina Zoo, is expecting, the first gorilla
                        pregnancy there in twenty-two years.

                        I visit my reproductive endocrinologist’s office in May and notice, in the air surrounding the
                        concrete and steel hospital complex, a strange absence of sound. There are no tall trees to
                        catch the wind or harbor the now incessant cicadas, and on the pedestrian bridge from the
                        parking deck everyone walks quickly, head down, intent on making their appointments. In the
                        waiting room, I test the leaf surface of a potted ficus with my fingernail and am reassured to
                        find that it is real: green, living.
